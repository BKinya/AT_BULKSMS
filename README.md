# AfricasTalkingApi_BULKSMS
This is a practices project on Africa's Talking API(s). It tests sending bulk messages from  a laravel application
To send the messages : Download Africa'sTalking gateway here: docs.africastalking.com/smslibraries/php
The gateway handles exceptions.

To send the message call sendMessage($username, $apiKey) on the instance of AfricasTalkingGateway class.I have done this in my 
helper class in the app direcory of the project
